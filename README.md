# Breakout-in-C
Classic Game, Breakout, written in C.

Run the program in C to initialize a window with bricks, a ball, a paddle, and a scoreboard. Click to start. Hit the bricks by bouncing the ball off of your paddle so that the ball destroys the bricks. You have a total of 3 lives. If the ball passes your paddle you will lose a life. Keep track of your score with the scoreboard and destroy all of the bricks with the ball without losing more than two lives to win the game!
